On 13 May 2024 @ 6.30pm I will be giving a BFI Reuben Library Talk. Tickets will go on sale on 21 March and can be purchased on the BFI website.

Here's the annoucement: 

We are delighted to welcome Daniela Berghahn to discuss her latest book Exotic Cinema: Encounters with Cultural Difference in Contemporary Transnational Film (Edinburgh University Press, 2024). Through close visual readings of the Indigenous film *Embrace of the Serpent* and the Hong Kong horror movie *Dumplings*, Daniela will undertake a critical reassessment of the problematic concept of exoticism; demonstrating that these films use the exotic gaze to draw attention to climate change and to critique the material excess of contemporary consumer culture.
