*Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress* is a rural romance that is set in the early 1970s against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution.  It is based on Sijie Dai's semi-autobiographical novel of the same title that charts his personal experience Mao's re-education programme. In the film, two friends from bourgeois urban backgrounds, Luo Min and Ma Jianling, are sent to the Sichuan province to live amongst the peasant community and work in the fields. Despite presenting a romanticized view of this difficult period in Chinese history, the French-Chinese co-production *Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress* is critical of Mao’s re-education programme, in which educated youth were ‘sent down’ from the city to undertake hard physical labour in the countryside so that they would abandon their bourgeois ideology and embrace the values of communism. Ironically, it is ultimately the Little Chinese Seamstress, an illiterate beautiful village girl and the object of the city boys Ma and Luo’s love, who is educated by them. The exposure to forbidden bourgeois literature, including Balzac’s novels, results in her re-education and prompts her to leave the remote mountain village in the Three Gorges region to head for the city.
