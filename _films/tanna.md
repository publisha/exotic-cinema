Set on the tropical island of Tanna in the South Seas, the film tells the story of star-crossed lovers, Wawa and Dain, from two hostile tribes. The film's iconography of lush tropical forests, gushing waterfalls and Indigenous tribes clad merely in grass skirts and penis sheaths is reminiscent of ethnographic documentaries as well as of  F. W. Murnau's *Tabu: A Story of the South Seas* (1931) which could be described as the Urtext of the South Sea paradise film genre.
