Tonight I have finally submitted my book manuscript Exotic Cinema: Encounters with Cultural Difference in Transnational Film to Edinburgh University Press. It‘s been quite a long journey but the discoveries I have made along the way have been truly fascinating and I have really enjoyed researching and writing the book. I hope that my readers will feel the same, when it’s published in September.

I have added a picture of my little notebook on exoticism here, since a giraffe [](<>)also features in the Introduction. I won’t reveal more for now…
