This morning, an email from the interior design company Clarke & Clarke landed in my inbox, advertising two new lines wallpapers and fabrics, called 'Exotica 2' and 'Wilderie'. Wilderie's highly ornate prints in particlar are exotic through and through - vibrant colours, exotic animals like tigers, giraffes and even red elephants with black spots.

These prints are part of a new (or not so new) interior design trend called 'Maximalism', a counter trend to the 'Minimalism'. AI tells me that 'Maximalism in interior design is *a bold, exuberant style characterized by "more is more"*. It emphasizes layering patterns, textures, and colors to create a visually rich and personalized space. Think of it as the antithesis of minimalism, embracing abundance and storytelling through decor.' 

Of course, this trend is not new at all, as Emmanuelle Gaillard and Marc Walter illustrate in their book *A Taste for the Exotic: Orientalist Interiors* (2011), 'in the 18th and 19th centuries, architects and decorative artists were constantly seeking new sources of inspiration to satisfy the demands of their rich patrons.While some revisited the canons of the classical world, others began to turn their eyes towards the East, and the 'Oriental' became a byword for spectacle and sensuality. The result was a wave of creative expression that encompassed everything from the smallest objets d’art to entire buildings. This sumptuously produced book explores the enduring allure of Orientalist decor and introduces the princes and aristocrats, artists and poets who commissioned these opulent interiors. Packed with images of beautiful decorative objects, extravagant interiors, sumptuous fabrics and ornate furniture, this book will transport the reader to another time and place.'

Although I object to the conflation of exoticism and Orientalism, regarding the latter as a sub-category of the more encompassing term exoticism, the desire for abundance, lushness and excess is common to both aesthetic sensibilities.
