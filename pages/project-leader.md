### Professor Daniela Berghahn 

I am Professor of Film Studies in the Department of Media Arts at Royal Holloway, University of London. Between 2017-2020, I was Associate Dean for Research at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and, between 2016-2018, Director of the Humanities and Arts Research Institute at Royal Holloway. 

I have widely published on post-war German cinema, the relationship between film, history and cultural memory and transnational cinema. My extensive work on migrant and diasporic cinema in Europe has been supported by a Research Fellowship and a Research Network Grant by the Arts and Humanities Research Council of Great Britain. The websites [www.migrantcinema.net](http://www.migrantcinema.net/) and [www.farflungfamilies.net](http://www.farflungfamilies.net/) document these two projects and contain a wealth of information and resources, including podcasts with filmmakers and other industry stakeholders, databases of relevant films, blogs, glossaries of critical terms and many more. 

My publications include *[Head-On](http://shop.bfi.org.uk/new-releases/head-on-gegen-die-wand.html#.VaPOlet-ouI)* (BFI, 2015), *[Far-flung Families in Film: The Diasporic Family in Contemporary European Cinema](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Far-Flung-Families-Film-Diasporic-Contemporary/dp/0748642900/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1368539377&sr=1-1&keywords=far-flung+families+in+film)* (Edinburgh UP, 2013), *[European Cinema in Motion: Migrant and Diasporic Film in Contemporary Europe](http://www.amazon.co.uk/European-Cinema-Motion-Diasporic-Contemporary/dp/0230278981/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1368539604&sr=1-1&keywords=european+cinema+in+motion)*(Palgrave Macmillan, 2010) and [*Hollywood Behind the Wall: The Cinema of* *East Germany*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hollywood-Behind-Wall-Cinema-Germany/dp/0719061717)(Manchester UP, 2005), a special issue of *[New Cinemas](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/nc/2009/00000007/00000001;jsessionid=b85gibitc9mm4.x-ic-live-02)* (2009) on Turkish German cinema and *[Unity and Diversity in the New Europe](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unity-Diversity-Europe-Barrie-Axford/dp/3906760308/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Unity+and+diversity+in+the+new+europe&qid=1625928282&sr=8-1)* (Lang, 2000). Her articles have appeared in journals including *Studies in World Cinema, Transnational Screens, Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television, Montage AV, Alphaville, New Cinemas, Oxford German Studies, German Life and Letters* and *Monatshefte*.
