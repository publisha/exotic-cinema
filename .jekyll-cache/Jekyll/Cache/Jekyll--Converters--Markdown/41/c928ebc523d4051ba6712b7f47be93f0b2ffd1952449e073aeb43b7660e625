I"¹<p><em>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</em> is a rural romance that is set in the early 1970s against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution.  It is based on Sijie Daiâ€™s semi-autobiographical novel of the same title that charts his personal experience of Mao Zhedongâ€™s re-education programme, also known as â€˜Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movementâ€™.  Like Zhang Yimouâ€™s <em>The Road Home</em> (1999) and <em>Under the Hawthorn Tree</em> (2010), <em>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</em> speaks to postsocialist Chinaâ€™s burgeoning nostalgia for Maoâ€™s socialist era, which has flourished since the economic reform of the 1990s and the new era of neoliberal global capitalism.</p>

<p>The film tells the story of two friends from bourgeois urban backgrounds, Luo Min and Ma Jianling, who are sent to the Sichuan province to live amongst the peasant community and work in the fields. Despite presenting a romanticized view of this difficult period in Chinese history, the French-Chinese co-productionÂ <em>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</em>Â is critical of Maoâ€™s re-education programme, in which educated youth were â€˜sent downâ€™ from the city to undertake hard physical labour in the countryside so that they would abandon their bourgeois ideology and embrace the values of communism. Ironically, it is the Little Chinese Seamstress, an illiterate beautiful village girl and the object of the city boys Ma and Luoâ€™s love, who is educated by them. The exposure to forbidden bourgeois literature, including Balzacâ€™s novels, results in her re-education and prompts her to leave the remote mountain village in the Three Gorges region to head for the city.</p>
