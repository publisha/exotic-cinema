I"¢<p><em>The Ramen Shop</em> uses food as a means of reconstructing family ties. Against the historical background of Japanâ€™s traumatic occupation of Singapore during World War Two a moving family-food-melodrama unfolds. Masato, a ramen chef based in Takasaki, a city in Japan, discovers a suitcase filled with memorabilia and his deceased motherâ€™s little notebook, after his father suddenly dies. He finds out that his mother, who was of Singaporean Chinese descent, was disowned by her own mother because she married â€˜the enemyâ€™, a Japanese man. To find out more about his familyâ€™s history and meet his grandmother, he travels to Singapore. There he meets a food blogger, explores Singaporean cuisine and tries to reconnect with his grandmother, whom he never met. By cooking ramen soup, based on a family recipe, he eventually wins the affection of his initially hostile grandmother and family harmony is restored.</p>
