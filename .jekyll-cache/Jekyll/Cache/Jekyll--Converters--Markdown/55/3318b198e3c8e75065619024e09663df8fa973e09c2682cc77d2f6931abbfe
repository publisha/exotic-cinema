I"]<p>Based on Maguerite Duras’ semi-autobiographical novel <em>Un barrage contre le Pacifique</em> (1950) and directed by the Cambodian filmmaker Rithy Panh, <em>The Sea Wall</em> is an unusual ‘imperialist nostalgia’ film (Rosaldo, 1989). First, despite inviting identification with the white French protagonist, the film is made by a Cambodian filmmaker, which is unusual for imperialist nostalgia films that normally glamourise colonial empires. Second, though adhering to some extent to the exotic iconography of imperialist nostalgia films, such as <em>Out of Africa</em> (Sydney Pollack, 1985),  <em>Indochine</em> (Regis Wargnier, 1992),  ‘Raj Revival’ films (Rushdie, 1992), such as <em>Heat and Dust</em> (James Ivory, 1983) and <em>A Passage to India</em> (David Lean, 1984), <em>The Sea Wall</em> portrays a poor family’s experience.</p>
