I"½<p><em>Raise the Red Lantern</em>Â is set in the 1920s and tells the story of Songlian, a nineteen-year-old girl who is forced by her stepmother to marry the much older Master Chen after her father dies and her family goes bankrupt. Chen has three wives already and Songlian, as his fourth wife or concubine, vies with the others for his attention and material favours and much jealousy and intrigue ensues.Â Carefully composed painterly tableaus  invite audiences to feast their eyes on opulent interiors as well as on the enchanting beauty of Gong Li, â€˜the poster girl of Fifth Generation Chinese films (Khoo 2007) and the first actress in the post-Maoist period to gain global recognition.Â </p>
