I"Í<p>WhenÂ <em>Atanarjuat</em> won the Camera dâ€™Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2001, it was widely celebrated as a watershed for Indigenous cinema since it was the first Inuit-produced film to win this prestigious prize. Based on a traditional Inuit legend and set in Igloolik in an unspecified past long before European explorers arrived in the Arctic, the narrative spans several decades.Â Â It tells the story of Atanarjuat,Â whose father Tulimaq was denied his rightful place as the tribal chief, and the ensuing feud between two families.</p>

<p>As I argue in my forthcoming book Exotic Cinema, Atanarjuat invites us to examine the boundaries and relationship between ethnographic realism and exoticism.</p>
