I"×<p><em>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</em> is a rural romance that is set in the early 1970s against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution.  It is based on Sijie Daiâ€™s semi-autobiographical novel of the same title that charts his personal experience of Mao Zhedongâ€™s re-education programme, also known as â€˜Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movementâ€™.  Like Zhang Yimouâ€™s <em>The Road Home</em> (1999) and <em>Under the Hawthorn Tree</em> (2010), <em>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</em> speaks to postsocialist Chinaâ€™s burgeoning nostalgia for Maoâ€™s socialist era, which has flourished since the economic reform of the 1990s and the new era of neoliberal global capitalism.</p>
