I"’<p>The popular feel-good movieÂ <em>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em>Â and its (less humorous and less successful) sequelÂ <em>The Second Best Marigold Hotel</em>Â explore what motivated a group of retirees to travel to India and how they adapt to the new life in India. The hotel â€˜for the elderly and beautifulâ€™, an old, architecturally stunning palace in Jaipur, one of Rajasthanâ€™s most touristy cities, has seen better days and is a far cry from the luxurious retirement home advertised in the photo-shopped marketing brochure that attracted the British guests to relocate.Â John Maddenâ€™s neo-colonial fantasy casts the British hotel guests as the heroic white saviours of endearing but incompetent Indians, who inject some entrepreneurial spirit into Jaipurâ€™s supposedly ailing economy, allowing the owners of the retirement hotel and the call centre to reap the rewards of global capitalism. By the end ofÂ <em>The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em>, all of the British pensioners are in gainful employment. In keeping with the filmâ€™s capitalist logic, economic productivity is equated with the mature protagonistsâ€™ successful rejuvenation.</p>
