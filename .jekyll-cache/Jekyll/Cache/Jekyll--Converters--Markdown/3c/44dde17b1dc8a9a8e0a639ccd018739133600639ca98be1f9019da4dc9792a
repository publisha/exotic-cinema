The filmâ€™s iconography of lush tropical forests, gushing waterfalls and Indigenous tribes clad merely in grass skirts and penis sheaths is reminiscent of ethnographic documentaries as well as of  F. W. Murnauâ€™s <em>Tabu: A Story of the South Seas</em> (1931) which could be described as the Urtext of the South Sea paradise film genre.</p>
