I"í<p>The film charts the journey of Hector, a slightly depressed, London-based psychiatrist who travels to â€˜genericâ€™ China, Tibet, Africa and Los Angeles in order to find out what makes other people happy. Throughout his journey, he jots down his realisations in memorable maxims, such as, â€˜Avoiding unhappiness is not the road to happinessâ€™ and â€˜Happiness is being loved for who you areâ€™ that serve as take-away lessons in life for the spectator and are handwritten across the screen. One of the destinations of Hectorâ€™s journey is a remote Tibetan monastery, perched on the edge of a steep mountain high up in the Himalayas and reminiscent of the convent inÂ <em>Black Narcissus</em>Â (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1947)</p>
