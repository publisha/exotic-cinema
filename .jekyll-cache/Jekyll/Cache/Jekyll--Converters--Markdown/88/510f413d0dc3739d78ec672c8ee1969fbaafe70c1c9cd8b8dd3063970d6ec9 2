I"Ô<p><em>Embrace of the Serpent</em> is a visually stunning black-and-white film that dramatises the encounters between an Amazonian shaman, Karamakate, a German ethnographer (Theo) and, some thirty years later, an American ethnobotanist (Evan), during the first half of the twentieth century. Though loosely based on the white explorersâ€™ travel journals, the film tells the story from Karamakateâ€™s perspective and is suffused with Indigenous myths and beliefs.</p>
