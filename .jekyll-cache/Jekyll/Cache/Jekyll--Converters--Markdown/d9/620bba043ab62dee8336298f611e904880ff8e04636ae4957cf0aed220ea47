Based on a traditional Inuit legend and set in Igloolik in an unspecified past long before European explorers arrived in the Arctic, the narrative spans several decades.  It tells the story of Atanarjuat, whose father Tulimaq was denied his rightful place as the tribal chief, and the ensuing feud between two families.</p>
